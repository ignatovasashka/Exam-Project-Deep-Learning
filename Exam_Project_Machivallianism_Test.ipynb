        "This article analyses how a set of personality traits, evaluated with the clssical Big Five Personality Inventory are correlated to Machiavellianism which is a psychological trait centered on interpersonal manipulation, unemotional coldness, and indifference to morality. There are also interesting demographic aspects that are related to this trait. Total score correlates mainly with Agreeableness, age, gender and marital status. Trying to model the data with more complex neural networks leads to some interesting results, that are worth taking a look. Seems that the major also got something to do with the MACH-IV score."

Model would converge slowly, if the inputs are not normalized, so we need to reduce data redundancy and scale the data. Total score comes directly from `Q1` to `Q20`, so we will drop all these columns and try to model the data towards the rest of the features. Analogically for the columns from `Extraversion` to `Openness_to_Experiences`. For now we will drop column `major`, too.\n",

Using stochastic learning where a single example is chosen from the training set at each iteration(batch size = 1), this estimate of the gradient is noisy, the weights may not move precisely down the gradient at each iteration. Using batch trainig we removes that noise and the conditions if convergence are well understood. Stochastic learning is often the prefered method particularly when dealing with very large data sets because it is much faster. It can also been used in online learning and keeps tracking changes.

        "Data consists of many categorical variables and there is pretty much variance in the data as a whole. This makes it dfficult to predict the total MACH-IV score with small error, but still we got best results with the Fourth Model, embedding the `major` column and data regularization. The First Model, which is wide and got data regularization, seem to be comparatively stable but biased. Second Model, which is much deeper but without data regularization got less bias in training set, but much more variance between training and validation set. Third Model got learning curve that shows noisy movements, that shows that data does not provide sufficient information to evaluate the ability of the model to generalize."

        "We could observe the correlation coefficients between total score in MACH-IV and the analysed features and there are not very strong correlations as a whole, but regarding personality and behaviour traits they are reasonable and very common in the field of study. Total score correlates mainly with Agreeableness, age, gender and marital status. Trying to model the data with more complex neural networks leads to some interesting results, that are worth taking a look. Seems that the major also got something to do with the Mach-score."
