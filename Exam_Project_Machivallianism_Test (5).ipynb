The second was an unflattering `View` of the nature of man as being weak and cowardly and easily subject to pressure from others. The third, less-clearly demarced theme dealt with what we called abstract `Morality` or, more accurately, the lack of it.\n",

This gives a clearer picture of which aspects the items represent (see, for a similar approach, Rauthmann, 2011). Table 1 summarizes the findings. The majority of items captured a negative and cynical view of people and the world.

        "At each iteration it is required a complete pass through the entire dataset in order to compute the average or true gradient. Using stochastic learning where a single example is chosen from the training set at each iteration(batch size = 1), this estimate of the gradient is noisy, the weights may not move precisely down the gradient at each iteration. Using batch trainig we removes that noise and the conditions if convergence are well understood. Stochastic learning is often the prefered method particularly when dealing with very large data sets because it is much faster. It can also been used in online learning and keeps tracking changes.

        "Nonlinear activation functions are what give neural networks their nonlinear capabilities. To turn the network's calculation into a probability value between -1 and 1, we have to pass the value from the output layer through a ‚Äútanh‚Äù formula. Sigmoid squashes the output value of a neuron to between -1 and 1 according to a specific curve.[[]](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/)\n",

        "The Rectified Linear Unit(ReLu) has become very popular in the last few years, but unfortunately, ReLU units can be fragile during training and can ‚Äúdie‚Äù. We may end up with a lot of zeroes and actually we may find that as much as 40% of your network can be ‚Äúdead‚Äù (i.e. neurons that never activate across the entire training dataset) if the learning rate is set too high.[[]](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/)\n",

Weights should be chosen randomly but in such a way that the tanh is primarily activated in its linear region. If the weights are all very large then the tanh will saturate resulting in small gradients that make learning slow. The default kernel initialiser is GlorotUniform that draws samples from a uniform distribution within [-limit, limit], where limit = sqrt(6 / (fan_in + fan_out)) (fan_in is the number of input units in the weight tensor and fan_out is the number of output units).[[]](https://keras.io/api/layers/initializers/)"
