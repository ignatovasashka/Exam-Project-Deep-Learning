Model would converge slowly, if the inputs are not normalized, so we need to reduce data redundancy and scale the data. Total score comes directly from `Q1` to `Q20`, so we will drop all these columns and try to model the data towards the rest of the features. Analogically for the columns from `Extraversion` to `Openness_to_Experiences`. For now we will drop column `major`, too.\n",

Using stochastic learning where a single example is chosen from the training set at each iteration(batch size = 1), this estimate of the gradient is noisy, the weights may not move precisely down the gradient at each iteration. Using batch trainig we removes that noise and the conditions if convergence are well understood. Stochastic learning is often the prefered method particularly when dealing with very large data sets because it is much faster. It can also been used in online learning and keeps tracking changes.
